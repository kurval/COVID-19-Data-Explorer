# Testautomation  
I have automated UI tests using Selenium library and Travis CI.  
Travis-CI is a continuous integration tool that will run tests for a GitHub repository every time commits are pushed.  
I'm running tests with both Firefox and Chrome in the headless mode, which is suitable for driving browser-based tests using Selenium and other tools.  
After tests are executed I can check my Travis CI build status page to see if my build passes or fails according to the return status of the build command.  
You can also get the status by e-mail after execution.

Build the container:  
```docker build -t st-app .```  

And run it:  
```docker run -p 8501:8501 --name st-app -it --rm st-app```  

Container is now available on:  
```http://<your docker-machine ip>:8501/```
